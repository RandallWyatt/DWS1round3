    <h2><a id="Index">Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!</a></h2>
    <p> The <strong>domestic cat</strong> (<em>Felis catus</em> or <em>Felis silvestris catus</em>) is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal.
            They are often called a housecat when kept as an indoor pet, or simply a cat when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.
            Cats are often valued by humans for companionship, and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.<br/> <br/>

            Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.<br/>
            Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.<br/>
            They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.<br/><br/>

            Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones, and types of cat-specific body language.<br/>
            Cats have a high breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, and the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.
            Since cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9500 years ago (<em>7500 BC</em>).<br/>
            A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from African wildcats (<em>Felis silvestris lybica</em>), having diverged around 8000 BC in West Asia.<br/><br/>
            Cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where humans live.</p>

    <h2><a id="Breeds">A List of breeds the are popular here in America. (They will be numbered to coincide with the photos).</a></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Persian</strong>: This breed has been number one since the <strong><abbr title="Cat Fanciers' Association ">CFA</abbr></strong> first started keeping records in 1871. Persians are affectionate and loyal but need their long fur groomed every day.</li>
        <li><strong>The Maine Coon</strong>: This breed has been in second place since 1992 and it's no wonder. This is a very gentle, loving creature who is large by cat-size. They weigh between 15 and 25 lbs. and have long fur like the Persian. However, they do not need as much grooming as the Persian.</li>
        <li><strong>The Exotic</strong>: This breed is like a Persian but with short fur. Their nickname is "Persian in Pajamas" because of their coloring. They are sweet like a Persian but only need brushing twice a week.</li>
        <li><strong>The Siamese</strong>: The yowl of a Siamese is very familiar to fanciers of this breed. And it's not just for attention - Siamese like to "chat" with their owners. This is a sleek cat who is very athletic. They usually gravitate to one person and are loyal and loving.</li>
        <li><strong>The Abyssinian</strong>: These cats are considered some of the lookers in the cat world. Thin and elegant with a shiny coat, they are active felines, very playful and friendly.</li>
        <li><strong>The Ragdoll</strong>: This breed gets its name from the way these cats go completely limp in your arms when you pick them up. They are cute and cuddly and large like the Maine Coon, weighing between 10 and 20 lbs. (males tend to be larger). This is a breed that should always be kept inside as they are very docile and would likely not defend themselves outside.</li>
        <li><strong>The Birman</strong>: If you want a cat that is dog-like, the Birman is a good choice. He is friendly, outgoing, even-tempered and flexible, a very rare trait to find in a cat. They are known to come when called and to greet you at the door like a pooch would. They have long silky hair that does not require much grooming.</li>
        <li><strong>The American Shorthair</strong>: This breed originally arrived in America on the Mayflower. They were bred for hunting and thus are excellent hunters, have good health and are a quiet cats. They make great family pets and are especially good with children.</li>
        <li><strong>The Oriental</strong>: This breed looks and behaves like a Siamese but comes in two fur lengths and over 300 color combinations. Their personality is similar to the Siamese but they are quieter.</li>
        <li><strong>The Sphynx</strong>: Known as the "Naked Climber" this breed climbs anything and is lively and athletic. They have an unusual appearance, sans fur, and come in a multitude of different skin colors. They are loyal and loving and demand constant attention.</li>
